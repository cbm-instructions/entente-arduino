###Driver for laZer computer

This is the basic control of the laser-pc.
The first laser is allways active if the arduino itself is active.
The second one will be activated with the first laser by hitting the right photoresistor.
Then the third like the second one until the last one is active. The user will expiriance a running fan, hdd and the glowing flare of lasers all the time :)
After that the second arduino will switch on and the user could enjoy a small game we made.

-entente-arduino we just like laser.
